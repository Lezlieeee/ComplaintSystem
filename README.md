Complaint System 

1.	What is it? 
A Complaints or Service Request System is an application designed to efficiently manage, track, and resolve complaints or service requests made by users or members of an organization or community. This system helps organizations maintain high standards of service by providing a structured and transparent process for addressing issues raised by users.

•Submit, track, and manage complaints or service requests from members.
•Assign and categorize complaints based on priority, urgency, and type.

2. Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?

	I created this Complaints or Service Request System to help improve communication and problem-solving within our community. Often, issues arise, whether it’s related to maintenance, safety, or service quality, and members might feel their concerns are not addressed in a timely or organized manner. This application provides a structured way for members to submit their complaints, track their status, and ensure they are resolved efficiently.
